A level generator and viewer.

PRESS 'P' TO QUIT.
Press 'Q' to regenerate the level. Doing this too often will cause huge memory use, and I don't know why.
Press 'M' to toggle the minimap. It scales!
Right-click to centre the viewport on the right-clicked spot.
Move the mouse to the edges of the screen to pan the view.
